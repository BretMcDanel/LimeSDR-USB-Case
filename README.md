# LimeSDR-USB case

## Introduction
This is still a work in progress.

I wanted protection and some shielding for my LimeSDR-USB which I use for various projects.  I opted for an aluminum case as opposed to acrylic or other plastic.

## The Case
I purchased a Hammond model [1455](https://www.hammfg.com/electronics/small-case/extruded/1455) "rounded rectangle" case measuring 120x78x27mm with aluminum end panels and plastic bezel.  I have seen these cases for sale at many places so they appear to be readily available.

## Printing the brackets
I designed two brackes for the board to sit on.  There is a [left](models/Board+Adapter+v7+Left.3mf) and a [right](models/Board+Adapter+v7+Right.3mf) bracket.

I 3D printed these with the following settings:
* I used a reasonably well calibrated 3D printer so parts are dimensionally accurate
* Material: PLA+
* Infill: 10% with Cura's lighting infill option
* Supports: Yes
* Temperature: 215c (works best for my printer and filament combo)
* Bed Temp: 60c (less results in print lifting on my printer)

Extra parts:
* 4x M3x6 screws

Print Orientation:
* Align them so the flush part of the screw holes are against the bed and the shelf at the top of the screw holes is facing up.  The curved portion requires supports.

## Mounting the board
I opted to mount on the fixed side, furthest away from the sliding belly plate.  This is mostly so if I decide I need a fan I can more easily machine that part instead of the whole case.

The parts need light sanding, especially where the support was.  They should test fit well into the case without too much force required to slide them.  I left mine so they can move but not bind when sliding in and out.

Using the screws mount the board.  The USB interface side mounts at the end of the brackets.

## TODO
* Finalize the end plates and CNC mill them
* * I do not yet have the dimensions as accurate as I would like them.
